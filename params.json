If you're creating anything but apps, the deploy process is manual or requires you to write your own deploy scrips and code from scratch. Sherpa allows you to deploy your artifacts in a repeatable manner from day one, without having to spend time writing code. \r\n  \r\n# How does Sherpa work? \r\n* The Sherpa library communicates with SharePoint exclusively through the Client Side Object Model (CSOM) \r\n  * Sherpa can thus configure both SharePoint on-premises and SharePoint Online\r\n* The bundled console application uses the Sherpa library allows us to quickly get started\r\n\r\n# Getting started\r\n1. Clone the project from github\r\n2. Add your fields, content types, taxonomy and site hierarchy etc through configuration, look at the sample config for guidance\r\n3. Build the solution and navigate to the out folder, typically Sherpa.Installer\\bin\\debug)\r\n4. Put any Sandboxed solutions you might have in the folder 'solutions' \r\n5. Start Sherpa.exe and pass the parameters 'url' and 'username' to hint where and as whom the application should connect. Add the flag --spo if and only if you are connecting to SharePoint Online. You can type 'Sherpa.exe --help' for help\r\n6. Sherpa will authenticate the user after you provide the password. After this you can choose which action you want to perform \r\n\r\n# Known limitations\r\n* On-premises: the application must run at one of your servers in your SharePoint farm\r\n* On-premises: the application runs exclusively in the context of the current user\r\n\r\n# Maintainers\r\nTarjei Ormestøyl [<a href=\"mailto:tarjeieo@puzzlepart.com\">tarjeieo@puzzlepart.com</a>]\r\nOle Kristian Mørch-Storstein [<a href=\"mailto:olekms@puzzlepart.com\">olekms@puzzlepart.com</a>]","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
